# Simple Chess Game

This is a simple chess game created entirely using the **Cline** extension with the **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro** AI model.

## Features

*   **Functional Chessboard**: A dynamically rendered 8x8 chessboard.
*   **Chess Pieces**: All standard chess pieces are included with their proper initial movements.
*   **Play Against AI**: You can play against an AI with three different difficulty levels:
    *   Easy
    *   Medium
    *   Hard
*   **Game Status**: A status display to indicate whose turn it is.
*   **New Game Button**: Start a new game at any time.

## Technology

This project was built from scratch using:

*   **Cline Extension**: All code, bug fixes, and feature implementations were done through natural language commands using Cline.
*   **Google Gemini 1.5 Pro**: The AI model that powers Cline to understand requests and generate the corresponding code.
*   **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Standard web technologies used to build the interface and game logic.
